<h2><a name='Intro'>1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Before attempting to build simulation components and
models using Viskit, it is important to have at least an elementary
understanding of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Event Graph methodology.  See
the references for background.  A brief overview of DES and Event Graphs is
provided in the appendix.</p>

<p>Henceforth it will be assumed that the reader has
knowledge of the mechanics of the DES, including how state variables change
value, how events arte scheduled, and how the Event List processes events and
advances time.</p>

<h2><a name='Event'>2. Creating a Simple Event Graph Component</a></h2>

<p>It is best to start with a very simple example. One of
the simplest Event Graphs is the "Arrival Process," a component that has one
parameter, one state variable, and one event.  This Event Graph may be defined
in a manner that is independent of the implementing programming language or
even of its Viskit representation.</p>

<h3>2.1. The Arrival Process Event Graph Component</h3>

<p>The Arrival Process is a generalization of the Poisson
Process.  The differences is that the times between arrivals are allowed to be
any arbitrary non-negative values.  </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Parameter: {t<sub>A</sub>} = sequence of
non-negative interarrival times.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>State Variable: N = number of arrivals (initially 0)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Event Graph (Figure 1):</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=188 height=115 src="tutorial_files/image001.gif"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 1. Arrival Process Event Graph</p>

<p>The state variable N is equivalent to the counting process
associated with a Poisson Process.  Unlike the Poisson Process, however, the
interarrival times {t<sub>A</sub>} need not be independent exponential random
variables, but any sequence of non-negative numbers.  So this component could
be used to represent a Renewal process (if {t<sub>A</sub>} were to be made an
iid sequence of non-negative random variables), a periodically recurring
sequence (making {t<sub>A</sub>} all identical values), or a correlated
sequence of non-negative random variables.</p>

<p>Before walking through the building of the Arrival Process
component, let us first see what the finished model looks like in Viskit.</p>

<h3><a name='EventArrival'>2.2. The Arrival Process Component in Viskit</a></h3>

<p>Start the Viskit Event Graph Editor and dismiss the Event
Graph Properties panel.  Select <span class='menu'>File <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> Open</span> from the menu bar, navigate to
Viskit’s examples directory (2 levels up from the initial location), select the file 
"ArrivalProcess.xml" and click "Open."  This will open the Arrival Process component in the Event Graph
editor, which should look like Figure 2.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image002.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 2. Arrival Process in Event Graph Editor</p>

<p>Note the similarity between the abstract Arrival Process Event 
Graph of Figure 1 and the Event Graph drawing in the left panel of 
Figure 2.  In general, any Event Graph component can be simply drawn 
as-is in the Event Graph Editor.</p>


<h3><a name='EventEvntParameters'>2.3. Defining Event Parameters</a></h3>

<p>Let us now walk through creating the ArrivalProcess component shown 
in Section 2.2.  Start by closeing all open event graphs. This can be done
with <span class='menu'>File <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> Close All</span>. Now open a new event 
graph by clicking <span class='menu'>File <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> New&nbsp;Event&nbsp;Graph</span>. 
Fill in the Event&nbsp;Graph&nbsp;Properties dialog for the name, package, 
and (optionally) a comment.  It should look roughly like Figure 3 (you may 
give your component any name and package you wish).  Click 
"Apply&nbsp;Changes" to close the dialog.  There should now be a nearly-empty 
Event&nbsp;Graph&nbsp;Editor window.  Verify that the name you have given 
your component is shown on the title bar of the window.  If you ever wish 
to change the Event&nbsp;Graph properties, click <span class='menu'>Edit <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> 
Edit&nbsp;Graph&nbsp;Properties...</span>, which will bring up 
the dialog box of Figure 3 again.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image003.png"> </p>
<p class="caption">Figure 3. Properties for New Arrival Process</p>

<p>When creating an Event Graph Component initially, it is
best to start by defining parameters, then state variables, and finally drawing
the Event Graph. So to start, delete the 'Run' event by selecting it and
cutting it by <span class='menu'>Edit <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> Cut</span>. This will bringup a popup
window to confirm your operation. Select 'Yes' and the event will be deleted.</p>

<p>Define the interarrival time parameter by clicking the <img src='tutorial_files/iconPlus.png' width='23' height='21'> icon in the 
bottom of the 'Event graph parameters' (see Figure 4).</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image004.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 4. Adding a Simulation Parameter</p>

<p>This will bring up a Parameter Inspector (Figure 5) that can be used to define 
the parameter (later this same dialog can be used to modify the parameter).</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=380 height=135 src="tutorial_files/image005.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 5. Parameter Inspector</p>

<p>Fill in the name of the parameter, its type, and an
optional comment.  Since the parameter is a sequence of possibly random values,
the interarrivalTime parameter should be defined as a
simkit.random.RandomVariate type (Figure 6).  You should save at this point 
<span class='menu'>File <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> Save</span>.  Navigate to a directory where 
you have write privileges and save the file.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=380 height=134 src="tutorial_files/image006.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6. Parameter interarrivalTime Entered</p>

<p>At this point there is not enough of the Event Graph to
generate the Java code. However, you can view the XML that has been created so
for by clicking <span class='menu'>File <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> View Saved XML</span> (Figure 7). 
You will need to save the file prior to viewing the XML. Do not save this file 
in a folder in the VisKit distribution.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=475 height=500 src="tutorial_files/image007.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 7. XML from Just Defining a Parameter</p>

<p>In a more complex model there will be additional parameters 
to be defined.  Before moving on to defining state variables, it 
is best to repeat the above steps until all of the parameters are 
defined. If you change your mind and wish to delete a parameter, 
simply select it in the Parameters panel and click the <img src='tutorial_files/iconMinus.png' width='23' height='21'> icon. 
In that case, a confirmation dialog will ask whether you really 
wish to delete the parameter.</p>


<h3><a name='EventStParameters'>2.4. Defining State Parameters</a></h3>

<p>Next, add the state variable by clicking on the <img src='tutorial_files/iconPlus.png' width='23' height='21'> icon at the
bottom of the State Variables panel. This is shown in Figure 8.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image008.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 8. Adding a State Variable</p>

<p>As with adding a parameter, clicking the <img src='tutorial_files/iconPlus.png' width='23' height='21'> icon for
adding a State Variable brings up a State Variable Inspector (Figure 9).</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=380 height=156 src="tutorial_files/image009.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 9. State Variable Inspector</p>

<p>In this case, the RandomVariate type is "left over" from
the parameter declaration.  For the Arrival Process model, 
the state variable (numberArrivals)  is of type int. Enter 
this information (Figure 10).  Click Apply Changes to go back 
to the Event Graph Editor window.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=380 height=156 src="tutorial_files/image010.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 10. Declaring the numberArrivals State Variable</p>

<p>As with parameters, it is best to continue defining all
the state variables for a more complex Event Graph component.  As with
parameters, any defined state variable can be deleted by first selecting it in
the panel and then clicking the <img src='tutorial_files/iconMinus.png' width='23' height='21'> icon.  A confirmation dialog appears for
all deletions.</p>


<h3><a name='EventNodes'>2.4. Creating Event Nodes</a></h3>

<p>The final step in creating the component is to draw the 
Event Graph itself and fill in the information defining the 
Event nodes and Scheduling/Canceling edges.  Start by dragging 
and releasing an Event node from the toolbar to the Event Graph 
palette on the left of the window (Figure 11).  Do this again 
to create a second Event node.  The Events will be given default 
names that should always be changed.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image011.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 11. Dragging Event Nodes to the Palette</p>

<p>To modify an Event node’s properties, double-click on it
to bring up the Event Node Inspector .  Double-click the evnt_0 node (Figure 12).</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="tutorial_files/image012.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 12. Event Node Inspector (Before Changes)</p>


<p>Change the name of the event to "Run" <span class='note'>[Note: Is case important?].</span> 
Recall that for Event Graphs, the Run Event is always scheduled 
on the Event List at time 0.0. The Run Event is responsible for 
initializing all state variables of the component and scheduling 
any other non-Run Events at the start of a run, if necessary.  
The state transition for Run in this case is to set numberArrivals
to 0.  To add a state transition to an Event, click the <img src='tutorial_files/iconPlus.png' width='23' height='21'> icon below the
State Transitions panel (at the very bottom of the Event Inspector).  This will
bring up the State Transition dialog (Figure 13).  </p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=431 height=217 src="tutorial_files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 13. State Transition Dialog</p>


<p>Since state transitions can only be applied to state
variables, the "state variable" part of the dialog can 
only be selected from previously defined state variables. 
However, if it is desired to define a new state variable, 
then the user can click the "new" button in the upper right 
(Figure 13) and the State Variable Inspector will appear 
for a new state variable definition (similar to Figure 8). 
Enter "0" for the state transition for numberArrivals 
(Figure 14) and click "Apply Changes."</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img width=431 height=217 src="tutorial_files/image014.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 14. The State Transition in Run.</p>


<p>The Event Inspector for Run should now look like Figure 15. 
Click Apply Changes to save the information and dismiss the Inspector.</p>

<p><img src="tutorial_files/image015.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 15. Event Inspector for Run after State Transition Defined.</p>


<p>Edit the other event.  It should be renamed to "Arrival" 
and its state transition should be to change numberArrivals 
to "numberArrivals + 1" (as defined in the original Event 
Graph of Figure 1). After filling in the state transition 
and renaming the event, the Event Inspector for the second 
event should look like Figure 16.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image016.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 16. Event Definition for Arrival Event.</p>


<p>You should save you model at this point.  You can also
view the saved XML to see how the model is being stored.  Note 
that in addition to Parameter and StateVariable elements, the 
XML now includes Event elements (Figure 17).  Note also that 
the Event elements contain StateTransition elements that 
specify that Event’s state transition.  In general, an Event 
element may have as many StateTransition elements as desired.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image017.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 17. XML After Defining Events.</p>


<p>Now that the Events are defined, you can also generate the 
Java code (even though the Event Graph component is not yet 
complete).  Click <span class='menu'>File <img src='tutorial_files/iconMenu.png' width='12' height='9'> Generate Java</span> 
to bring up a window with the corresponding Java code 
(Figure 18).  At any point the user has the option of 
generating the Java code, saving it (click on the 
<span class='menu'>Save Source and Close</span> button), 
and modifying the code (outside of VisKit).  However, changes 
produced in this manner cannot be imported back to Viskit (at this time), 
so such an action is one-way.  Staying in Viskit, the user 
can check the model by clicking the <span class='menu'>Compile test</span> button. 
</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image018.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 18. Generated Java</p>


<p>A successful outcome of "Compile test" is shown in Figure 19.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image019.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 19. Successful Compile Test</p>


<h3><a name='EventSchedules'>2.5. Defining Event Schedule Edges</a></h3>

<p>Returning to the main Event Graph window, the final step
is to draw and configure the scheduling edges. To draw a scheduling edge, fist
go to "Create Scheduling Edge" mode by clicking on the Scheduling Edge Mode
icon (<img width='23' height='21' src="tutorial_files/icon001.gif">, see Figure 20).  
The Event nodes will be surrounded by a dark square, and when the mouse is over 
an Event, the cursor will become a hand.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image020.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 20. Going to &quot;Create Scheduling Edge&quot; Mode</p>


<p>When in this mode, a scheduling edge is created by
dragging the mouse from one Event node (the scheduling Event) to another Event
node (the scheduled Event).  Drawing the scheduling edge between the Run Event
and the Arrival Event results in the window looking like Figure 21.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image021.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 21. After Drawing Scheduling Edge</p>

<p>Self-scheduling edges (one of which is needed for the
Arrival Event, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2) are created by dragging from the Self-scheduling edge icon onto the Event for which the self-scheduling edge is desired (Figure 22).  In this case, drag the self-scheduling edge icon onto the Arrival Event to create the self-scheduling edge from Arrival to itself (Figure 22).</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image022.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 22. Self-Scheduling Edge.</p>

<p>Each edge usually must be edited to enter the necessary
information.  Double-click on the Run-Arrival edge to bring up its Inspector (Figure
23).  The source and target events are determined by the drawing, and so are not editable.   Also, although it appears that whether an edge is Scheduling or Canceling can be modified by the radio buttons, in fact they
can’t.  If a Canceling edge is desired, then it must be drawn separately.  Canceling
edges will be covered in a later section.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image023.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 23. Inspector for Run-Arrival Scheduling Edge (before edit).</p>


<p>For simple models, only the time delay and the edge
condition are typically modified.  For this model, we need 
to enter the delay of an interarrival time.  The 
interarrivalTime parameter was defined as a RandomVariate, 
which uses the generate() method to generate pseudo-random
variates.  Therefore, the time delay for this edge is given 
by interarrivalTime.generate() (Figure 24).  Click 
<span class='menu'>Apply Changes</span> to return to the main Window.</p>

<p class=BodyTextCentered><img src="tutorial_files/image024.png"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 24. Delay entered for Run-Arrival Scheduling Edge.</p>


<p>Similarly, edit the Self-Scheduling edge for the Arrival
Event by double-clicking on it.  Its inspector should appear just like Figure 23 (except that both the Source and Target events are "Arrival").  The delay should be filled in as "interarrivalTime.generate()" just as for the Run-Arrival edge.</p>

<p>The model is complete!  Save the model and, if you wish,
view the generated XML (File | View Saved XML, Figure 25).  You can also generate the Java code and do a compile test.  </p>

<p class="caption"><img width=475 height=500 src="tutorial_files/image026.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 25. XML for Final model, Showing Schedule Element in Run Event</p>

<p>Congratulations!  You have created your first Event Graph
component.  Although this is about the simplest possible Event Graph Component,
the Arrival Process is nevertheless a very useful and reusable component.  A
DES model can be created in the Assembly Editor using only this component, and
that is what we will do next.</p>
