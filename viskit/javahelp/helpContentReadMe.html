<title>Authoring JavaHelp for Viskit</title>
</head>
<body>
This is a summary of how to add to the help system for the Viskit
application.  Content is added into both XML and HTML files which are described
below.
<p>
JavaHelp support in Viskit is contained in these project areas:
<ul>
<li>
1. <code><b>viskit/javahelp/</b></code> subdirectory in the CVS archive, and the deployment (build) directory
</li><li>
2. <code><b>jhall.jar</b></code> library in the CVS archive, and the deployment (build) directory
</li><li>
3. Java source files, especially viskit.Help.java, which has the menu bar action handlers, which launch the help window.
</li><li>
4. A target in <code>build.xml</code>, which builds the search database from the html
files and copies the javahelp CVS directory to the javahelp build directory.
</li><li>
(5. If/when <u>context-sensitive</u> help is implemented, other .java files in the project
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Further details:
<p>
The <code><b>javahelp/</b></code> directory contains the following:
<ol>
<li><code><b>vHelpSet.hs</b></code> -- This is the "master" file that initializes the
javahelp system.  To simply add content, it does not need to be edited unless further indexing functionality is added.
</li>
<li>
<code><b>vHelpMap.jhm</b></code> -- A map file which defines tokens to be used in
other parts of the help system.  Look at <code>vHelpTOC.xml</code>, for instance, to see how
it is used.  Add more entries as appropriate.
</li>
<li>
<code><b>vHelpTOC.xml</b></code> -- The master TOC tree is defined in this file.  As more content
is added, there should be more topics and subtopics added here.
</li>
<li><code><b>javahelp/Pages/</b></code> -- All html and image content goes in this directory.
</li>
<li><code><b><i>vHelpIndex.xml</i></b></code> -- This file is currently unused.  If an index
is built for the Viskit help system, it will go here.
</li>
</ol>
<p>

The <code><b>jhall.jar</b></code> is Sun code which implements the JavaHelp system, as well
as containing the search-indexing utility.
<p>

Summary:&nbsp;&nbsp;Write your table of contents in <code>vHelpTOC.xml</code>.  Define your tokens in <code>vHelpMap.xml</code>.  Write
your html, css, images, etc., and put them in <code>javahelp/Pages</code>.
