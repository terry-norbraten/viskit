                 Seems that Apple&reg; is still not working fully with
                 Oracle&reg; where Java&trade; is concerned.  Applications that
                 require Java&trade; to launch on Mac OS&reg; will be met with a
                 pop-up dialog as described <a href="http://kbpdfstudio.qoppa.com/?p=2393">here</a>.

                 Granted, the given link refers to PDF Studio 9&reg;, but the
                 given instructions pertain in order to get this application
                 running.

                 Please click on the above link now to open a browser window
                 that will remain open after this installation completes.  The
                 link that points to the legacy Apple&reg; Java 6 SE
                 installation page may need to be opened in another browser,
                 i.e. Firefox&reg;, Chrome&reg;, etc.
