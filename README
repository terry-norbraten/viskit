                      Welcome to the Viskit codebase

If you have arrived at this file as a result of directly downloading the Git
archive, we suggest looking at the Ant target "help" in build.xml.  This will
take you through the basics of how to use Viskit.

This is a simple roadmap to the entire codebase as found on GitHub:

Directory           Description
---------           -----------
MyViskitProjects    Project specific files for Assemblies and EventGraphs and
                    their specific source and compiled versions
Schemas             XML Schemas and DTDs for generating JAXB source code
configuration       Various config files used for Viskit operation and logging
doc                 Repository for various text document concerning Viskit operation
   api              Automatically created when you want to invoke the Ant doc target
installer           Configuration files for the iZpack installer API
lib                 3rd-party libraries needed to compile and run Viskit
license             3rd-party and Viskit license information
nbproject           NetBeans IDE specific project files
src                 Source code used to build Viskit and associated applications,
                    such as the installers
test                JUnit tests for the main codebase

Depending on how you got here, some of these directories may not be present
on your machine.

Documentation and Support
--------------------------

The majority of documentation about Viskit is on a public website. This can
be accessed at

https://savage.nps.edu/Savage/developers.html#DES

There you will find some tutorials, a FAQ and general documentation about
the project, contributors etc.

If you have problems with Viskit, please send an issue ticket to:

If you have found bugs in Viskit, please send an issue ticket to:

https://github.com/terry-norbraten/viskit/issues

to see if someone has already found the same bug as yours. We are a federally
funded research institute dedicated to advancing modeling and simulation best
practices to include open source discrete event simulation (DES) modeling. 
Priority of response on any bugs may or may not be fast, depending on what the 
various developers are currently working on. If you require support, please 
contact the Naval Postgraduate School's (NPS) Modeling, Virtual Environments and 
Simulation (MOVES) Institute.
