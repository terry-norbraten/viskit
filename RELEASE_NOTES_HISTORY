These are release notes for Viskit from 0.1 forward.  Each release will
detail its functionality in meeting the applicable specifications and document
any known issues.

Release: 0.6.1(May 10, 2011
---------------------------------
Major changes since 0.6.0:

  Implement a dedicated Viskit Project space "MyViskitProjects" in order to
  properly designate a project space for specific user projects

  Fix NPE when canceling out of creating a project

  Fix bug where the Viskit Project file chooser was causing unnecessary
  recursive calls

  Implement a draconian runtime fix to nuke the ${user.home}/.viskit directory
  incase of a startup failure that has historically rendered Viskit unusable
  until .viskit was manually deleted anyway.  The goal will be to never have to
  do this if configuration metadata was stable enough to continue usability.

  Improve iZPack installer support for creating 64 bit installers.  Shoe-horned
  is a USA flag to denote "English" as an install language vice the UK flag.


Release: 0.6.0(October 8, 2010)
---------------------------------
Major changes since 0.5.4:

  Upgrade to Simkit v1.3.8

  Provide for launching Viskit either standalone, or as a process within another
  runtime application observing proper EDT protocol

  Disable TRANG building of the EG and Assy Schema's from DTD.  These Schemas
  are now solid on their own.

  Fix bug where .svn folders would display on the LegosTree for SimEntities and
  PropertyChangeListeners

  Bugfix 1248

  Improve parsing for BasicSimEntity subclasses in order to populate the
  LegosTree

  Display current Viskit Project name in the main app title bar

  Improve EG caching scheme so that we don't recompile unnecessarily

  Improve recently opened files and projects history caching

  Fix NPE bug when opening an existing Project from a newly installed Viskit

  Bugfix 706

  Upgrade to JAXB v2.1.8

  Improve output stream flushing when writing out to text at runtime

  Fix bug where EG description fields were not rendering for a newly added EG
  tab

  Improve JDK shutdown if Viskit is a third-party lib within another app

  Bugfix 1364

  Viskit was becoming too tightly integrated with a specific project (Savage
  Studio).  Broke up such dependencies and refactored to be a standalone app
  that can be integrated into other applications.

  Fix issue where Assembly Adapter and PropertyChangeListener edges behave
  properly if the user cancels an edit function

  The Assembly description field in not yet implemented and noted in source

  Assembly properties (metadata) are now immediately reflected in the Assembly
  Runner

  The proper mode for a PropertyChangeListener is singular.  However, for back-
  wards compatibility for older EG, allow plural as well

  Fixed bug where improper GraphMetaData was being supplied to a new Assembly

  Fix issue where EG and Assy Editor toolbars were not being made visible when
  creating new EGs and Assys

  Better resizing accomplished for the Assembly Editor to allow more weight to
  the JGraph side of the splitpane

  Implemented full XML validation for EGs and Assy XML files

  Minor EG and Assy Schema modification to allow for SMAL metadata to be used
  as CDATA entries

  Implemented multi-file opening choice for EGs and Assys

  Bugfixes 1396, 1398 & 1412

  Fix issue to allow building of the ParameterMap and Constructor where no
  concrete doRun or doReset methods were defined

  Implement package creation when naming newly created EG and Assy files

  Implement configuration awareness of current Viskit project

  Added a "Verbose" checkbox on each Assembly Node editor which operates as a
  "detailed output."

  Clamp simulation output to 8M and truncate from the front if required

  Implement dumping of Event List only if not in verbose, or reallyVerbose modes

  Internal class checking to populate EG editors unable to discern unqualified
  class names except java.lang.*

  Viskit Project can now be stored and opened from any location on the local
  machine

  Bugfixes 1400 & 1407


Release: 0.5.4(August 12, 2008)
----------------------------------------
Major changes since 0.5.3:

  Implement a clear recent files option to the File menus

  Implement a "detailed output" checkbox option for EG node inspector dialog

  Implement an incrementing trailing digit in node names when dragging new node
  onto the Assembly editor canvas.  Add check for existing node name prompting
  use of the incrementing trailing digit.


Release: 0.5.3(August 5, 2008)
---------------------------------
Major changes since 0.5.2:

  Implement specific platform L&F options upon app startup

  Fix issue in SimkitXML2Java translator when an interrupt would cause an unclosed
  if block statement causing startup compile errors

  Fix for issue where varargs can throw a mostly harmless compiler warning if
  there is only one arg supplied to the SimkitXML2Java translator

  Fix issue where the EG inspector dialog "Apply" button had no effect

  Bugfix 1399


Release: 0.5.2(June 11, 2008)
-------------------------------
Major changes since 0.4.8:

  Bugfixes 1402 & 1405

  Implement creating new projects from either the EG or Assy editor panel menus

  Bugfix 1373

  Announce any compile errors to output screens


Release: 0.4.8(June 3, 2008)
-------------------------------
Major changes since 0.4.7:

  Implement Log4J for debugging, output info status

  Switch from Sun's Base64 encoder to Apache version

  Fix NPE when user didn't check "Enabled Analyst Report" and attempted to view
  anyway

  Fix bug where a SimplePropertyDumper could not co-exist with a
  SimpleStatsTimeVarying PCL defined on the same Assembly

  Stricter BeanShell interpreter checking for EG and Assy authoring, esp. for
  typed containers <SomeType>

  Enable regression line fitting to scatter plot graphs generated for the
  Analyst Report

  Implement enabling of the Assembly Run panel only after a successful Assy
  compilation and validation.

  Implement firing property changes using state variable "getters".  Container
  getters return a clone for the FPC in the doRun event.

  Modify the Assembly DTD to offer a raw count or mean of raw count statistic
  for all PCL dialogs

  Implemented a "Number x of n Replications" output on the Assembly Runner

  Update JFreeChart to v1.2.0.  Improve chart output by counting raw counts vice
  the mean of raw counts for histogram charts

  Fix issue where Assys were being compiled while the EG tree was still being
  parsed for compilation causing conflicts

  Upgrade Simkit to v1.3.4

  Bugfix 1183

  Improvements to Analyst Report building, editing, reopening and rendering in
  HTML

  Implement Ant targets to translate EGs and Assy XML files to Java source

  Further decoupling of Diskit being too tightly integrated w/ Viskit for
  convenience of another application

  Refinements to external javac exec process for EGs and Assys

  Implemented generics utilzing JAXB v2.1.  This is a whole Viskit upgrade
  prompting tagging a pre-generics JAXB branch.

  Authored a script to delete temp files and history, a hack to clean up cruft
  left behind from Viskit multiple operation of quarantining separate
  classpaths, keeping scratch EG and Assy files, and multiple compilations of
  source code.

  Implement notification of when an Analyst Report is ready to view at the end
  of a local Assembly Run of 1 or more replications

  Bugfixes 936, 1195, 1246, 1249 & 1260

  Implement figure caption auto increment in the Analyst Report.  Xalan required
  as 3rd party lib for this functionality

  Implemented a cleaner exit strategy vice a blunt System.exit(0) scheme

  Implemented image capturing of all opened EG and Assy files for PNG insertion
  in the Analyst Report

  Improved Analyst Report generation by consolidating all material required for
  report in a project specific location.  Fix various bug discovered in AR
  generation improvements.
