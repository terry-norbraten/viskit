Post release fixes:

  Fixed issue where if we had already compiled an Assembly, then the ClassLoader
  has changed, and we need to go back and fix something in the Assembly.  Switch
  back to the Viskit ClassLoader and disable the Assembly Run tab until the
  Assy is recompiled.

  Fixed timing issue when an Assembly file is given as an argument at startup
  which firsts loads associated Event Graphs, but the Assembly was being
  compiled before the Event Graphs finished causing ClassLoader issues due to
  the Assembly being compiled in a separate ClassLoader.

  Shortened the path names for the LEGOs tree to be more readable.  If the user
  does not select the Analyst Report tab to be visible, then the Enable Analyst
  Report checkbox on the Assembly Runner panel will not be enabled.

  Better Mac OS X installer support by upgrading the javaApplicationStub to work
  better with Oracle's JDK 8+.  Better Windows installer support by actually
  getting it to work with the executable jar's Class-Path header.  Still need to
  fully test on Unix though.

  Implemented better message pop-up reporting for the user to better determine
  what errors have occurred

  Bugfix 1377

  Allow deselection of both the Design of Experiments (DOE) and Cluster Run
  panels via the Files -> Settings dialog -> Tabs Visible

  Ensure that when switching Event Graph tabs, or to the Assembly Editor, any
  unsaved EGs will be saved, revalidated and re-compiled

  Remember user set sizes for the main app frame so that it will restart at
  those dimensions

  Fix a long standing bug where modifications to EGs did not get re-validate
  XML, generate java source, or re-compile.  Fix bug where a duplicate icon
  could reappear in the EG node pallette

  Fix UI issue where a node name could be changed for either an EG or Assy and
  would not reflect until a mouse was re-clicked on the editor canvas

  Refactor source code packaging to more closely resemble MVC organization


Release: 0.7.0(November 14, 2014)
-------------------------
Major changes since 0.6.2:

  Platform specific startup items are discerned at app startup, i.e. MAX OS X
  "About Viskit"

  Fix a long standing bug where local variables declared in an EG doRun method
  where not being utilized as indicies for arrays in state transition changes

  Enable a single click selection of a Viskit project icon w/o having to select
  "OK"

  Upgrade to JAXB v2.2.11

  Fix issue where a single opened EG did not close when selecting another Viskit
  project

  If a user selects JVM exit and an EG, or Assy were modified, allow a cancel
  closing Viskit when the save dialog appears

  Always show what Viskit project is open in the app title bar

  Implemented a nuke.dot.viskit Ant target.  This is an attempt to draconically
  fix an issue where Viskit startup in an unknown state via its .viskit kept
  config files and can't recover to usability

  Fix bug to allow generically type arrays to be properly translated to java
  source

  Fix a NPE in the AssemblyControllerImpl

  Had to break the "dirty Assembly" issue in the DOE's LocalBootLoader so as to
  load generated and modified EGs and Assys from build/classes of each loaded
  Viskit project.  The documentation for viskit.doe.LocalBootLoader explains the
  requirement for multi-threaded Grid Design Point Experiments to run with fresh
  ClassLoader contexts.  At this time, Grid (cluster) runs are disabled until
  such time as we can re-implement using the Viskit Project paradigm

  Annotate a note in the InternalAssemblyRunner where the RandomVariate seed was
  is being reset via reflection.  This is critical in creating standalone
  projects where they are run independently outside of the Viskit environment

  Upgrade to JGrpah 5.14.0.  Improved threading on the drawing canvas, but need
  to refine how the control points could make better scheduling edge arcs.

  Upgrade JAXB to 2.2+

  Fix EG node cancel cursor bug issue

  Upgrade to Simkit v1.4.2

  Fix issue with generating a lot of temp files and jars and not cleaning up
  after the main app shuts down

  Implemented a completely enclosed runtime compilation scheme using the JDK's
  runtime compiler for EG and Assy generated source code, thus removing the
  requirement to ship the current JDK's tools.jar with the installers.  A JDK is
  still required to run Viskit though.

  Improve the whole Viskit app build process; must faster compile time

  Ensure that a Viskit project /lib populated with jars is read upon startup in
  order to resolve external classpaths selected in the Setting Dialog

  Ensure the lib/ext can be ignored for pure Viskit operation, i.e. no
  requirement for Diskit, or other advanced DES libs

  Upgrade to JDom v2.0.5

  Upgrade to Xerces v2.11.0

  Upgrade Apache Commons libs to v3.2.1

  Fix NPE on model property editor

  Improve iZpack installer creation
