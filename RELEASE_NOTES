Post release fixes / upgrades / issues:

  ***** ISSUES:

  At this time, the XML to Java translators cannot handle a super type generic
  container declaration in XML, then instantiate it as a dynamic type, i.e.
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();  The static declaration will match the
  dynamic type accordingly.

  Because of the unique nature of XML IDs, we are not able to have similar
  method names, i.e. Arrival, in the same EG file even with differing method
  signatures.  As such, subclassing is still possible, but the user will have
  to manually track which similar Event to schedule/cancel, i.e. Arrival,
  Arrival2, etc.

  If the CNTL key is held down while attempting to drag and edge control point
  a IOOBE will be thrown by JGraph v5.14.0.  This may be fixed in a subsequent
  release of JGraphX (new code base name) should we decide to upgrade to v6+.

  If a single Assy file was closed, it will close all open EGs file including
  non-associated EGs.  This happens due to the EG caching system that relies on
  parsing SimEntities of Assy files to know which EG to keep open

  If one strays from the Java Bean convention of naming variables by starting
  with a lower case letter, then, be prepared to manually enter variable names
  of interest when parameterizing a PropertyChangeListener edge such as a
  SimplePropertyDumper as the PropertyDescriptor returned by the Introspector
  will force lower case, i.e. variable int N will be returned as "n"

  BeanShell checking of code snippets was a good idea in the beginning, but
  since we are only giving BeanShell a snippet and not the whole source file, it
  can only perform very minor primitive checking and some instantiating checks
  of generic containers.  The compiler will notify of any errors at which time
  the user can investigate and fix during EG or Assy authoring.

  ****** FIXES / UPGRADES:

Release: 1.0.0(March 10, 2015)
-------------------------
Major changes since 0.7.0:

  Major refactor of the MVC components to implement undo / redo on both the EG
  and Assy editors

  Fixed potential NPE when attempting to capture a frame image with no file
  loaded in either the EG or Assy. editors

  Further improvements to the state transitions panel in that when we wish to
  invoke methods on state variables, a combo box of choices is presented.  If a
  method requires a parameter, the parameter is typed into the action field

  Fixed issue where canceling a local variable method call in the state
  transition dialog did not initiate an auto row delete

  Improvements to the state transitions panel in that we can now invoke void
  return type, zero parameter method calls as part of a state transition.  This
  is accomplished by declaring a local variable within an EventNode, or by using
  an event argument supplied by an Edge.  The type will be used to reflect on
  which method types will be available for use on either the local variable, or
  the argument

  Implemented capability to provide an unqualified Java class name and have the
  fully qualified class found on the classpath.  Implemented in viskit.VStatics

  Fixed bug to prevent edge parameter values from being wiped out during a node
  modification

  Preventing a case where we have simkit.jar in both the working classpath and
  in a project's /lib directory.  We don't need to expose multiple libs of the
  same name in the LEGOs tree because they happen to be in two different places

  Added a feature to the state transition panel whereby we can now assign local
  variables to return type invoke on "." methods, i.e. boolean b = queue.add(E);
  Before, we could only accomplish this type call and fire the state transition
  manually via code block entries.  This is a step in reducing code block usage.

  Fixed and issue where super type more than one level up were not being
  resolved in the EG to Java translator

  Corrected issue with EG image capture being stuck on the last showing EG and
  not cycling through open EG tabs

  Improved EG Node tooltips by including code blocks

  The translator for generation of Event Graph XML to Java now handles generic
  array types as well as primitive array types, generic containers, and of
  course, primitive types.

  JGraph extended and overridden components now behave like actual DES EG nodes
  in that EG node edges take on the classic parabolic shape when two edges
  connect between nodes.  Self-referential edges now begin hear the top of the
  node instead of at the bottom and form around the node in a clockwise fashion.

  Fixed issue with the StateVariableDialog where if an array type was entered in
  the type field, the array length field was still disabled

  Fixed issue of the metadata description field not updating after an edit

  Fixed potential NPE in the PclEdgeInspectorDialog when the Introspector can't
  determine a property type

  Fixed an issue where EG and Assy file open history was not being preserved

  Fixed an issue where a PropertyChangeListener edge with no selected property
  was forcing a "" (empty string) property which is non-existent.

  Implemented a self-referential drag and drop, or menu selected canceling edge
  option for the EG editor.

  Implemented an extension feature for EGs.  Instead of extending the default
  SimEntityBase, type in your SimEntityBase subclass name instead when creating
  a new event graph, i.e. extends ArrivalProcess.

  Fixed an issue where and IllegalStateException would occur when added a
  simkit.random.RandomVariate to the parameter list

  Fixed an issue with not being able to use normal java package naming
  conventions when crafting EG package names

  Fixed an issue with cut & paste where the selected cache was not being cleared
  after a confirmed delete by the user.

  Fixed a bug where canceling the edit on any of the Assembly edge dialogs
  caused that edge to delete.

  Fixed an issue where a good intention to have nodes snap to grid on either
  editor pallette caused the node cluster to keep positioning down and to the
  right upon every file save.

If an EG XML file save goes bad, or its corresponding source code
compilation reveals an error, the tab that represents the EG will change from
a green color (signifying good XML, good source compilation) to red which
signifies either an XML save, or its source compilation went bad.  The user will
be unable to advance to the Assembly Editor tab until the problem is corrected.
If an EG compilation went bad, any previously compiled byte code *.class files
of the same name will be deleted preventing inclusion on the classpath.  A bad
compile will also cause removal of the EG MD5 hash entry from the project's
viskitProject.xml file.  If upon start up, a previously opened XML file passes
validation, but fails compilation, the user will again be unable to advance to
the Assy Editor tab.

  Fixed an issue where if a EG did not compile correctly, the whole EG LEGO tree
  for would dissappear

  Bugfix 1425

  More gracefully handle and inform the user of a missing third party library

  Fixed issue where if we had already compiled an Assembly, then the ClassLoader
  has changed, and we need to go back and fix something in the Assembly.  Switch
  back to the Viskit ClassLoader and disable the Assembly Run tab until the
  Assy is recompiled.

  Fixed timing issue when an Assembly file is given as an argument at startup
  which firsts loads associated Event Graphs, but the Assembly was being
  compiled before the Event Graphs finished loading causing ClassLoader issues
  due to the Assembly being compiled in a separate ClassLoader.

  Shortened the path names for the LEGOs tree to be more readable.  If the user
  does not select the Analyst Report tab to be visible, then the Enable Analyst
  Report checkbox on the Assembly Runner panel will not be enabled.

  Better Mac OS X installer support by upgrading the javaApplicationStub to work
  better with Oracle's JDK 8+.  Better Windows installer support by actually
  getting it to work with the executable jar's Class-Path header.  Still need to
  fully test on Unix though.

  Implemented better message pop-up reporting during EG and Assy loading for the
  user to better determine what errors have occurred

  Bugfix 1377

  Allow deselection of both the Design of Experiments (DOE) and Cluster Run
  panels via the Files -> Settings dialog -> Tabs Visible

  Ensure that when switching Event Graph tabs, or to the Assembly Editor, any
  unsaved EGs will be saved, revalidated and re-compiled

  Remember user set sizes for the main app frame so that it will restart at
  those dimensions

  Fix a long standing bug where modifications to EGs did not get re-validate
  XML, generate java source, or re-compile.  Fix bug where a duplicate icon
  could reappear in the EG node pallette

  Fix UI issue where a node name could be changed for either an EG or Assy and
  would not reflect until a mouse was re-clicked on the editor canvas

  Refactor source code packaging to more closely resemble MVC organization
