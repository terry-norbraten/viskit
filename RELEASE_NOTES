  ***** ISSUES:

  On Mac OS X 10.10.3 (Yoseimite) & JDK 1.8.0_45, in the default L&F mode, while
  inputing EG Parameters when the user selects more... to expose RandomVariate
  types, a NPE will be thrown:

    at com.apple.laf.AquaMenuPainter.paintSelectedMenuItemBackground(AquaMenuPainter.java:153)

  Select the Platform L&F for OS X users as the work around.  On Win machines,
  the platform L&F is not the best choice as the background coloring for tabs is
  quite quirky.  The default L&F for Win machines is recommended.

  On Mac OS X 10.10.3 & JDK 1.8.0_45, the cancel and scheduling cursors on the
  JGraph pallete will revert back to the select cursor (arrow) when a node or
  edge inspector pops up.  If the user selects cancel or or schedule mode again,
  the cursor will not change (remains in select) mode until the user moves the
  cursor out of the JPanel containing the JGraph component and menu bar up to
  the parent Frame's title bar.  Then it will change as expected.

  Due to the way the SimkitXML2Java generates EG extensions of super
  SimEntities, a default constructor will not be generated in subclasses
  accordingly.  When it is time to parameterize EG constructors at Assy creation
  time, an EG with a default (no arg) will conveniently establish a Random
  Variate Factory instance automatically within the Event Node Inspector.  A
  subclass of a SimEntity will not automatically establish a RVF instance,
  therefore one must select the instantiation wizard, select "factory", accept
  the change and then a RVF instance will be established and ready to accept
  direct (String, Object...) inputs.

  At this time, the XML to Java translators cannot handle a super type generic
  container declaration in XML, then instantiate it as a dynamic type, i.e.
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();  The static declaration will match the
  dynamic type accordingly.

  Because of the unique nature of XML IDs, we are not able to have similar
  method names, i.e. Arrival, in the same EG file even with differing method
  signatures.  As such, subclassing is still possible, but the user will have
  to manually track which similar Event to schedule/cancel, i.e. Arrival,
  Arrival2, etc.

  If the CNTL key is held down while attempting to drag and edge control point
  a IOOBE will be thrown by JGraph v5.14.0.  This may be fixed in a subsequent
  release of JGraphX (new code base name) should we decide to upgrade to v6+.

  If a single Assy file was closed, it will close all open EGs file including
  non-associated EGs.  This happens due to the EG caching system that relies on
  parsing SimEntities of Assy files to know which EG to keep open

  If one strays from the Java Bean convention of naming variables by starting
  with a lower case letter, then, be prepared to manually enter variable names
  of interest when parameterizing a PropertyChangeListener edge such as a
  SimplePropertyDumper as the PropertyDescriptor returned by the Introspector
  will force lower case, i.e. variable int N will be returned as "n"

  BeanShell checking of code snippets was a good idea in the beginning, but
  since we are only giving BeanShell a snippet and not the whole source file, it
  can only perform very minor primitive checking and some instantiating checks
  of generic containers.  The compiler will notify of any errors at which time
  the user can investigate and fix during EG or Assy authoring.

  ****** FIXES / UPGRADES:

  We now label the name of the parameter in addition to its type for the Event
  Graph Node Inspector Dialog's Instantiation Panels.  This will aid in proper
  EG parameterization

  JavaHelp contents now render external links.  Update jhall.jar to v2.0_05
  to account for missing helper classes from v2.0.0.

  Config files for initial startup will now force the platform L&F for Macs and
  leave the default L&F for Win and other machines.  This is due to what is
  described above under issues.

  Now using relative paths for all images generated for the Analyst Report


Release: 1.0.10(June 03, 2015)
-------------------------
Major changes since 1.0.5:

  Attempted to fix some buggy NPE within JGraph lib when running on Mac OS X


Release: 1.0.5(June 01, 2015)
-------------------------
Major changes since 1.0.0:

  Fixed NPE when unqualified names were being used for local variables as well
  as in parameters.  User is now notified to fix by stating qualified names.

  Fixed issue where user desires a specific replication to be verbose and only
  that one in particular.  If a specific rep. is given, that will uncheck the
  verbose box

  Since canceling edges to nodes with parameters do not have to actually send
  parameters, we've hidden the parameters sub-panel from the canceling edge
  inspector

  Fixed NPE in the Source Window frame title when generating Assy source code

  Added support for when a user wishes to generate a statistical run report in
  that when the report is ready for further editing/input by the user, the UI
  will auto select to the analyst report tab

  Added support for the user to zip a current Viskit project, to include the
  current debug.log, and email it to the Viskit mailing list

  Fixed and exception issue when verbose debug was selected from the Settings
  dialog

  Fixed several menu activated NPEs when no EG or Assy files are loaded

  Implemented an Open Recent Projects menu item for the EventGraphViewFrame

  Added a header to the output replication report to better understand the order
  of stats data presented.

  Fixed issue where designPointStats names were not being correctly set during
  Assy. runtime causing a NPE and incorrect stat output due to name mismatches.

  Fixed an issue where the default Random Number Generator's seed reset call was
  performed incorrectly and was unnecessary.  The default RNG is the Mersenne
  Twister who's seed state is generated at instantiation time in Simkit with a
  default seed.

  Fixed issue when a user used the Assy editor's recent project's list to
  select a recent project and the selected project's title wasn't correctly
  displayed.

  Added support for Object... (varargs) for the
  RandomVariateFactor.getInstance(String, Object...) static Simkit method.  We
  can now write out java.lang.Object... to XML, parse it and apply it correctly
  during SimEntity parameterization at Assy. creation time.

  Major refactor to implement a combo box selection for scheduling edge time
  delays.  Can now select parameters, local or argument vars and invoke methods,
  or simply type in a delay value

  Fixed a potential NPE issue in the File Based Assembly Node (FBAN) when
  parsing node files that are of *.class origin only and not XML
