There are two differences between the trunk version of Viskit and the OA3302
branch.  Namely, the OA3302 branch is a simplified version of the trunk.  The
differences are in three source files and are annotated like this:

/* DIFF between OA3302 branch and trunk */
code that is commented out for OA3302 branch
/* End DIFF between OA3302 branch and trunk */

The affected source files are:
viskit.EventGraphAssemblyComboMainFrame
viskit.InternalAssemblyRunner
viskit.RunnerPanel2

A search on the above comments will expose where in the source these are.
