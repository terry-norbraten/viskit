<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Viskit is an application for defining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models that
    autogenerate Java source using the Simkit library.</p>

<p>
    The Viskit application allows you to build a collection of event graphs that
    describe the behavior of various entities in a simulation environment.
</p>

<p>
    Included in some distributions:  Diskit, which is a java package of
    Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) utilities and Simkit entities for 3D
    movement support and is used as a module in Viskit for developing networked agent
    behaviors.
