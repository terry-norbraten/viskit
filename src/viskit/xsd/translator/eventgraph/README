The SimkitXML2Java class translates simkit.xsd or simkit.dtd files into Java classes.

This class uses JAXB XML Bindings for Java based on simkit.xsd which is in turn
generated from simkit.dtd.

See simkit/xml for code generation of the JAXB for details.

To run, see sample run script. The class may also be used by other classes.

The JAXB jars included in the lib directory
should be in the classpath to compile, generate bindings, and run the translator;
see SOURCE_ME, which should be customized for your environment.
