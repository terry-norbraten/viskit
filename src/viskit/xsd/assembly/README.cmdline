To use the Assembly XML 2 Java compiler from the command line, have viskit.xsd.assembly.SimkitAssemblyXML2Java in your classpath, and a file to translate that adheres to either assembly.dtd or assembly.xsd in the path as well.

From the command line:

%java viskit.xsd.assembly.SimkitAssemblyXML2Java -f myFile.xml

note: the file extension is ignored, so it could be a myFile.abc etc.

There are 2 tags within assembly.dtd that provide for useful output, one is the Output tag, which causes a named SimEntity to print itself to stdout, the other is the Schedule tag, which sets the stopTime of the Scheduler, doing so will cause the simulation to execute.
